        <h2>Tightening credit spreads hit 27-year low</h2>
        <p>
          Corporate bonds offer a higher yield than government bonds to attract investors and compensate for the higher
          risk, they must offer a premium, this premium is called “Credit Spread”. On Thursday 18th September 2025, US
          investment grade (IG) corporate bond spreads tightened to their narrowest levels in 27 years, to just 72 basis
          points, following a low of 73 basis points reached in August 2025, the lowest since 1998.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          This historic compression in spreads follows a significant surge in investor demand for corporate debt, driven
          largely by expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Though bond yields remain
          elevated compared to the last 15 years, they continue to appear attractive to investors seeking yield in a
          global environment of low or negative returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tightening credit spreads indicate robust investor confidence in the credit quality of corporations,
          supported by stable earnings forecasts and improving fundamentals across many sectors. Optimism has also been
          bolstered by advances in sectors such as technology, where productivity gains are helping underpin corporate
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, this tightening is occurring amid significant volumes of corporate debt set to mature over
          the next few years, raising questions about refinancing risks as higher interest rates loom. While current
          fundamentals remain supportive, these factors highlight the importance of cautious optimism and careful
          credit selection as market participants navigate this unique environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interplay of still-elevated yields coupled with record-tight spreads creates an attractive risk-return
          dynamic for investment grade corporate bonds, but investors should remain alert to potential volatility as
          economic and policy conditions evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          This market environment underscores the delicate balancing act investors face: benefiting from higher yields
          than seen in recent decades while managing the risks inherent in one of the narrowest credit spreads in
          modern history.

        <h2>HSBC’s quantum computing trial improves bond trade prediction</h2>
        <p>
          HSBC has announced on September 25th 2025 it has made a breakthrough by using quantum computing to improve
          algorithmic trading in the corporate bond market. In collaboration with IBM, HSBC ran a trial that combined
          quantum and classical computing techniques to predict the likelihood of completing bond trades. The results
          showed up to a 34% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional classical methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algorithmic bond trading involves quickly pricing customer trade requests using real-time market data and risk
          assessments. Quantum computing enhances this process by exploring a larger and more complex solution space,
          allowing subtle pricing signals in noisy market data to be uncovered, something classical computers alone may
          miss.
        </p>
        <p>
          This trial used real production-scale trading data on multiple IBM quantum processors, showing that current
          quantum technology can already provide practical advantages in financial markets. HSBC’s Group Head of Quantum
          Technologies described the results as a landmark achievement in applying quantum computing to solve real-world
          business challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          While quantum computing is still developing, this successful experiment signals a new frontier for trading
          strategies, risk management, and market efficiency. The collaboration highlights how emerging quantum
          innovations might soon become integral tools in finance, helping to optimize pricing and improve
          decision-making in complex, data-driven markets.

        <h2>Fed delivers first cut since 2024; path signals gradual easing</h2>
        <p>
          The FOMC cut 25 bps to 4.00%–4.25% citing softer labor data; guidance implies further cuts into year-end.
          Financing costs should ease, while the committee remains vigilant on inflation risks.

        <h2>Beyond the “Magnificent Seven”: a broader AI leadership set</h2>
        <p>
          The era of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, which dominated the AI-driven tech surge over the past few years,
          appears to be evolving. This original group—Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla—has
          indeed driven strong market gains and technological advances since the launch of ChatGPT nearly three years
          ago. However, Wall Street analysts now suggest a broader and more diverse set of AI leaders is emerging,
          challenging the dominance of the original seven. New names like Broadcom, Oracle, and Palantir are gaining
          prominence thanks to their strong AI-driven revenue growth and unique roles in the AI ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, the performance within the Magnificent Seven has diverged. Companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and
          Microsoft have seen significant share price gains this year due to strong AI adoption, while Apple, Amazon,
          and Tesla have lagged behind because of slower growth prospects. This shift reflects a growing recognition
          that future AI winners may come from firms addressing large and untapped markets with focused AI innovations,
          rather than simply legacy tech giants. For example, Palantir's shares have soared over 130% this year amid
          robust demand for its AI software platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This broader perspective on AI investing is also reflected in new market indexes and strategies, such as the
          Cboe Magnificent 10 Index that incorporates chipmakers and software specialists alongside the original seven.
          Investors are increasingly aware that as AI matures, leadership may rotate to companies providing critical
          infrastructure, software, or niche applications. In sum, while the Magnificent Seven remain influential, the
          AI investment narrative is expanding, encouraging investors to look beyond traditional large caps to capture
          the next phase of AI-driven growth.
